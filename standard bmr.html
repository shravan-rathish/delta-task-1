 <h3>What is BMR?-BMR definition</h3>
<p>Basal Metabolic Rate is the amount of energy a human body uses when it is completely at rest.
 It's the amount of energy your body needs to support its vital functions: breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, brain and nerve functions to name a few. 
 The organs that use the most energy at rest are the brain, the central nervous system and the liver. 
 What's interesting is that, throughout the day, more energy is consumed by the regulation of fluid volumes and ion levels than
 in the actual mechanical work of contracting muscles (e.g., breathing).
 We automatically correct concentrations and the amounts of different substances in various areas of our body to preserve homeostasis (a state of the steady internal conditions). 
 Sometimes this requires transporting substances through barriers (e.g., cell membranes) and against a concentration (or molarity) gradient.
 This means that particles are transported from space, with their low concentration, to space with their higher concentration - a process which requires energy.
 On a whole body scale, this amounts to a lot of energy. It also explains why our central nervous system consumes so much energy in terms of Basal Metabolic Rate.
 When a neural impulse is conducted, a lot of different ions change their location. Afterward, they need to be transported back to their original place.
<br><br>
People regularly use more energy than their Basal Metabolic Rate.
 It is because most people do not spend all day in bed without moving!
 Walking, running, working, talking, and even digesting are actions that require some extra energy greater than the Basal Metabolic Rate.
 To achieve such a low expenditure of energy, you have to be physically and psychologically inactive. In other words, you cannot use any muscles or think intensively.
 You need to be as relaxed as humanly possible. Other necessary criteria include staying in an environment with thermal comfort and not eating for a certain period.
 The latter condition assures that you will not be using energy to digest food. In a scientific setting, BMR is often measured during a period of sleep.
 <br><br>
 Your BMR accounts for about 60% to 75% of your Total Energy Expenditure (TTE), depending on your lifestyle and activity level.
 The Total Energy Expenditure is the total number of calories you burn every day. The rest of your TTE comes from the physical activities (walking, talking, eating, etc.) and food digestion.
 Physical activities account for about 20% of your Total Energy Expenditure but can vary a bit depending on how often you exercise for and its intensity.
 Food digestions, or as some say postprandial (after-meal) thermogenesis, uses around 10% of your TTE. BMR tends to decrease with age and with a lower lean body mass.
 On the other hand, increasing your muscle mass will most likely increase your BMR.
 We have written more about the different things that influence the Basal Metabolic Rate in the factors affecting BMR paragraph.
</p>
<h3>How to calculate BMR?-The BMR Formula</h3>
<p> There are multiple formulas used to calculate BMR. Nowadays, the Mifflin-St Jeor equation is believed to give the most accurate result and, is therefore what we used in this calculator. This BMR formula is as follows:
<br><br>
<b class="c1">BMR (kcal / day) = 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) – 5 * age (y) + s (kcal / day),</b>
<br>
<b class="c1">where s is +5 for males and -161 for females.</b>
<br><br>
We also have calculators that determine your Basal Metabolic Rate based on other formulas.
 For a long time, the most common way to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate was the Harris-Benedict equation.
 It was initially published back in 1919, and for over 70 years it was considered to be the best Basal Metabolic Rate formula available.
 It was later replaced with another Basal Metabolic Rate formula that turned out to be even more accurate – the Mifflin St Jeor Equation.
 Nevertheless, you can still find many BMR calculators that use the Harris-Benedict Equation, but they are slowly but surely being replaced with the new formula.
<br>
The third known equation is Katch-McArdle formula, used to calculate the Resting Daily Energy Expenditure (RDEE).
<br>
In our Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator, we use the Mifflin St Jeor Equation to give you the most accurate BMR score.
</p>
<h3>BMR vs RMR</h3>
<p>When researching Basal Metabolic Rate, you may have also encounter the term RMR. It stands for the Resting Metabolic Rate.
 As these terms sound very similar and have a very similar meaning, it is very easy to get confused.
 But don't worry, we will explain it to you shortly.
 Resting Metabolic Rate, much like BMR, is also a measure of a human body energy expenditure without performing any additional activities (so at rest).
 However, there is a slight difference. Resting Metabolic Rate also includes the energy used for the digestion of food.
 <br><br>
 Our body has to use some energy to transform the food in our gut into substances that can be used by it.
 As we have already mentioned in the what is BMR? – BMR definition paragraph, food digestion accounts for around 10% percent of your Total Energy Expenditure.
 Because of that, RMR has a higher value than BMR. We use the modified Harris-Benedict formula, instead of Mifflin St Jeor equation, to calculate Resting Metabolic Rate.
This webpage is quite new and doesnt have the facility to calculate your RMR. But stay tuned for further updates.

<h3>Factors Affecting BMR</h3>
<p>Each cell, tissue, and organ in your body requires a constant supply of energy to survive.
 It logically follows that the more your body weighs (and the more cells it has), and the more kilocalories it needs.
 With increasing weight, your Basal Metabolic Rate will rise as well. However, BMR doesn't depend solely on weight.
 In many different studies, researchers found other factors affecting our Basal Metabolic Rate value. Here, we mention some of them: 
<br><br>
<b>FFM</b> – standing for fat-free mass. It is the weight of your body without the weight of any fat tissue.
 If you think about it, it makes sense - muscles, even at rest, use up a lot more of energy than fat.
 In fact, the main function of fat tissue is to preserve energy in the form of fatty acids. A big ratio of fat-free mass to fat-mass increases BMR.
 Two men may weigh 220 pounds, but if one of them has more muscle due to working out, he will have a significantly higher Basal Metabolic Rate. 
<br>
<b>FM</b> – shortcut for fat-mass. As the name suggests, it is the weight of all the fat in our body. Although much lower, fat-mass also has an influence on our Basal Metabolic Rate.
<br>
<b>Age</b> – your Basal Metabolic Rate increases with each year as you grow up and as your weight increases.
 For adults, BMR tends to decrease as they get older. Researchers mainly attribute this to the change in compositions of the human body as it ages;
 the fat-free mass drops, and thus the Basal Metabolic Rate becomes lower.
<br>
<b>Sex</b> – men have a statistically higher BMR than women. The reason is that their fat-free mass is, on average, higher.
 This is why the creators of this equation added a special adjustment to the equation for each sex (plus 5 kcal/day for man, and minus 161 kcal/day for woman).
 <br>
 <b>Genetics</b> – every person is slightly different regarding their BMR. Some of these differences can be explained by the rate of your metabolism encrypted into your DNA.
<br>
<b>Exercise</b> – the amount you exercise affects your BMR, especially body-building exercises (e.g., bench press). When you develop your muscles,
 you increase the weight of your fat free mass. Remember not to overextend when exercising. 
<br>
<b>Body temperature</b> – your BMR increases as the temperature of your body rises. The higher the temperature (e.g. during a fever), the quicker various chemical processes in your body happen.
 Because of that, there is a higher demand for energy, and thus your BMR increases.
 <br>
 <b>Temperature of environment</b> – in colder temperatures your body needs to create more heat to preserve its proper temperature. This leads to an increase in BMR.
<br>
<b>Hormones</b> – hormones are substances produced by the many glands of the body. Their main task is to regulate the functions of other organs and tissues.
 The most interesting gland in terms of BMR modification is, without a doubt, the thyroid gland. Hormones excreted by this gland are responsible for regulating the rate of your metabolism.
 When they are in high concentration in blood, your BMR increases and vice versa.
<br>
 <b>Pregnancy</b> – when a woman is pregnant, there is another organism developing inside her body. Naturally, we are talking about the fetus (the baby).
 It has its own metabolism and BMR. Because it receives all the nutrition from its mother, we need to add its BMR to BMR of its mother when calculating the basic required calorie supply.
